# magicVilla_API

MagicVilla primarily functions as a platform for retrieving villa information. As an administrator, you have the capabilities to edit, delete, and add villas to the site. Additionally, admins can search for villas using keywords.

The front end of the web application utilizes the Razor View Engine alongside Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. 

The backend is powered by C# and ASP.NET, providing a robust and scalable foundation.

The webpage features role-based authentication secured with JWT tokens, and implements application versioning (v1, v2), caching, and pagination to enhance performance and user experience.

Finally, the application is published on Azure Cloud and runs in a Docker container, demonstrating a modern approach to deployment and cloud services.
